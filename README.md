# DAA-tik-tok-toe
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.Tic-tac-toe  is  not  a  very  challenging  game  for  human
 beings. If you’re an enthusiast, you’ve probably moved
from   the      basic   game   to   some   variant   like   three
dimensional tic-tac-toe on a larger grid. If you sit down right now to play ordinary three-by-three tic-tac-toe with a friend, what will probably happen is that every game will  come  out  a  tie.  Both  you  and  your  friend  can
 probably  play	perfectly,  never	making  a  mistake  that
would allow your opponent to win and so on .
